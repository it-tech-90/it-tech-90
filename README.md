Greetings! it-tech-90 (Spencer Reed - the ORIGINAL one) here with nothing of utter interest (yet).
Currently working as a ServiceNow Solutions Architect and looking to expand my knowledge in JavaScript.

This account will house different repos for different things I'm doing to get better at JavaScript.

In my code I'll try to keep consistency with updating comments to explain things as I go through them and I'll try and keep my old (crappy) code (if I make better code)
  commented out so there's insight into my thought process.
  
I would like to be able to build apps (outside of ServiceNow) and explore more of what JavaScript can do.

Professional Experience:
  - College degrees: Associates in Network Administration; BS in Software Programming & Management (Didn't learn JS in this one, oddly enough)
  - Interned at MTI School in networking department for a year
  - Interned at small IT business for a year
  - Worked as a Help Desk technician for a few years
  - Worked as a Service Desk technician for a few years
    - Promoted to Service Desk Supervisor for some years (became ServiceNow system admin)
  - Career change to SaaS Platform Engineer for a couple years
  - Contract as a ServiceNow Developer for a couple years
  - Currently working at VETS (Veteran Enhanced Technology Solutions) as a Solutions Architect for ServiceNow projects
 
 Personal Life:
  - Married :two_men_holding_hands: with 2 dogs 🐶 🐶
  - Enjoy reading a book from time-to-time 📖
  - Enjoy carbs...god I love CARBS
  - I also enjoy exercising 🏋️
  - I dabble in the giggle greens (often) 😆 🥬

I'm gonna try and keep this consistent as I do want to expand my skills and learn more. I have a fantastic support system and appreciate any and all suggestions!
